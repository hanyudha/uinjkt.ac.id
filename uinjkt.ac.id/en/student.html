                                <li>Entrepreneurial Activities: Universities often provide support for students
                                    interested in starting their own businesses. Students can develop their own creative
                                    business ideas and receive guidance and resources to make them a reality.</li>
                                <li>Student Publishing: Some universities have student journals or publications where
                                    students can publish their written works, essays, and creative works of art. This
                                    gives students the opportunity to showcase their talents and creativity to a wider

                                <p style="text-align: justify;">Student character development at universities is an
                                    important part of holistic education. Universities can play a significant role in
                                    shaping student character through various initiatives, programs and learning
                                    environments. The following are some ways in which student character development can
                                    be implemented in the university environment:</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li style="text-align: justify;">Coaching and Mentoring Programs: Universities can
                                        provide coaching and mentoring programs that help students develop personal,
                                        leadership, and social skills. These programs may include leadership training,
                                        career counseling, and personal coaching.</li>
                                    <li style="text-align: justify;">Community Service Activities: Through community
                                        service programs, students can learn about empathy, a sense of social
                                        responsibility, and community service. These programs may include volunteer
                                        projects, social campaigns, or participation in activities aimed at improving
                                        community welfare.</li>
                                    <li style="text-align: justify;">Values-Oriented Curriculum: Universities can
                                        integrate subjects oriented towards character development, such as ethics,
                                        leadership, or social responsibility, into the academic curriculum. This helps
                                        students understand important values and be responsible in practicing those
                                        values.</li>
                                    <li style="text-align: justify;">Mentoring and Academic Coaching: Mentoring and
                                        academic coaching programs can help students develop self-discipline,
                                        perseverance, and responsibility for their studies. Through mentors, students
                                        can receive the guidance, support, and inspiration needed to achieve their
                                        academic and personal goals.</li>
                                    <li style="text-align: justify;">Personality Development Activities: Universities
                                        can organize various activities that foster student personality development,
                                        such as self-development workshops, motivational lectures, or soft skills
                                        development events. This activity helps students recognize their potential and
                                        strengthen their self-confidence.</li>
                                    <li style="text-align: justify;">Extracurricular Activities: Through participation
                                        in extracurricular activities, such as sports, arts, or volunteer activities,
                                        students can develop social skills, teamwork, and emotional resilience. This
                                        activity also allows them to learn to manage time and balance between studies
                                        and non-academic activities.</li>
                                    <li style="text-align: justify;">Positive Campus Ethos: Universities can create a
                                        campus climate that promotes positive values, inclusivity, fairness, and mutual
                                        respect. By creating a supportive campus culture, universities can become
                                        environments that facilitate positive character growth for students.</li>
                                </ol>
                                <p style="text-align: justify;">By paying attention to these aspects, universities can
                                    play an important role in shaping students' character, helping them become
                                    individuals who are strong, have integrity and are ready to face challenges in the
                                    real world.</p>
