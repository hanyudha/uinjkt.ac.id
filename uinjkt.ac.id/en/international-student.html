        <p>International students at universities are students who come from another country and decide to pursue higher
            education at a university outside their home country. They study abroad with the aim of gaining different
            academic, cultural and social experiences. International students often choose to study abroad for a variety
            of reasons, including the opportunity to obtain a quality education, exposure to new cultures, and global
            career opportunities.</p>
        <p>They usually face special challenges, such as adapting to a different culture, a different language, and an
            educational system that may be different from their country of origin. Universities usually have specific
            support services for international students, including help with accommodation, campus life, study permits
            and language support.</p>
        <p>International students also often contribute to the diversity and openness of the campus environment,
            bringing unique experiences and perspectives to class discussions and out-of-class activities. Many
            universities promote diversity and inclusivity by accepting international students and encouraging cultural
            exchange between local and international students. This helps prepare students for the increasingly
            connected global environment of the workplace and international society.</p>
