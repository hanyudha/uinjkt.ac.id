        <p><strong>Beginning of Establishment</strong></p>
        <p>Tracing the establishment of UIN Syarif Hidayatullah Jakarta actually reveals part of the story of the
            struggle of Indonesian Muslims to realize their desire to have a higher education institution with an
            Islamic, modern and Indonesian perspective.&nbsp;<span class="">Therefore, the establishment of UIN is
                basically a product of the Muslim community's desire to form and develop an educational institution that
                can galvanize its students into reliable cadres of the community who can respond to the needs of society
                and changing times.</span></p>
        <p>As a higher education institution, the history of the development of UIN Jakarta cannot be separated from the
            history of the development of Islamic higher education in Indonesia in responding to the needs of modern
            Islamic education.&nbsp;The embryo of UIN Jakarta can be traced to the founding of the Islamic Boarding
            School Luhur (in the period leading up to independence), the Islamic High School in Padang and Jakarta in
            1946, the Indonesian Islamic University (UII) in Yogyakarta, and the establishment of the Department of
            Religion Service Academy (ADIA) in 1957 in Jakarta until become UIN Syarif Hidayatullah now.</p>
        <p><strong>June 1, 1957 |&nbsp;Academy of Religious Sciences (ADIA)</strong></p>
        <p>The establishment of UIN Syarif Hidayatullah Jakarta began with the formation of the Religious Sciences
            Service Academy (ADIA) as a service academy for the Department of Religion on June 1 1957, based on the
            Decree of the Minister of Religion, Number 1 of 1957. The establishment of ADIA was intended to educate and
            prepare civil servants to achieve educational diplomas. academies and semi-academies to become experts in
            religious education at Public High Schools, Vocational Schools and Religious Schools.&nbsp;At its inception,
            ADIA occupied the Jakarta Islamic University (UIJ) campus on Jalan Madura and in its second year on Jalan
            Limau, the current UHAMKA campus.&nbsp;In the third year they just occupied a campus in Ciputat called
            Kultur Sentrum (KS);&nbsp;UIN campus now.&nbsp;At that time ADIA had 43 students divided into two
            departments, namely: the Sharia Department (Religious Education), and the Lughat al Arabiyah Department
            (Arabic Language Department) and one Special Department for Army Imams using Arabic as the language of
            instruction, plus using Indonesian as an introduction to general subjects</p>
        <p>In accordance with its function as a service academy, students who take courses at ADIA are limited to
            students who receive study assignments consisting of: Religious Employees/Teachers within the Department of
            Religion from various regions throughout Indonesia who enter based on selection.&nbsp;ADIA's leadership at
            that time was Prof.Dr.H.Mahmud Yunus as Dean and Prof.&nbsp;H. Bustami A.Gani as Deputy Dean.&nbsp;ADIA's
            anniversary was then designated as the anniversary or Dies Natalis of UIN Syarif Hidayatullah Jakarta.</p>
        <p><strong>August 24, 1960 |&nbsp;IAIN alJamiah al-Hukumiyah / IAIN Jakarta Branch</strong></p>
        <p>In further developments, in 1960 based on PP No II of 1960 dated 24 August 1960 ADIA merged with PTAIN
            (Islamic College) in Yogyakarta to become IAIN al Jamiah al Hukumiyah.&nbsp;It was inaugurated by the
            Minister of Religion in a ceremony at the Yogyakarta kepatihan building on August 24 1960 (2 Rabi&acirc;tul
            Awwal 1380 H).</p>
        <p>ADIA became the Jakarta branch of IAIN with two faculties, namely the Faculty of Tarbiyah and the Faculty of
            Adab with Prof.Dr.H.&nbsp;Mahmud Yunus as Dean of the Faculty of Tarbiyah and Prof.H.Bustami A.Gani as Dean
            of the Faculty of Adab.</p>
        <p>After becoming the Jakarta branch of IAIN, the student body no longer consisted of only service bond students
            (employees on study assignments) but also accepted free students.&nbsp;So the number of students increased
            to 282 people.</p>
        <p>In 1962, based on the Decree of the Minister of Religion of the Republic of Indonesia No. 66 of 1962 on 15
            November 1962, the Ushuluddin Faculty was opened, which was a metamorphosis of the Da'wah wal Irsyad
            Department (Army Imam Department) with the Dean, Prof. HM. Toha Yahya Umar, and inaugurated by the Minister
            of Religion of the Republic of Indonesia, KH.&nbsp;Syaifuddin Zuhri with the first lecture taking place at
            the Al Azhar Mosque.</p>
        <p>Along with the opening of the Ushuluddin Faculty, IAIN Jakarta Branch then became independent and became IAIN
            al Jamiah al Hukumiyah Syarif Hidayatullah Jakarta.</p>
        <p><strong>February 25, 1963 |&nbsp;IAIN al Jamiah al-Hukumiyyah Syarif Hidayatullah Jakarta</strong></p>
        <p>In Government Decision No. II of 1960, it was stated that the aim of establishing IAIN was to provide higher
            education and become a center for developing and deepening knowledge about the Islamic religion.&nbsp;It is
            hoped that increasing the level of education in the fields of religion and Islamic science will also mean
            raising the standard of life of the Indonesian people in the fields of spirituality and
            intellectualism.&nbsp;IAIN is expected to become a social and academic expertise institution.</p>
        <p>Considering its rapid development and based on Government Regulation No. 27 of 1963 that IAIN, which already
            has three faculties, is considered capable of standing independently, then with the issuance of Decree of
            the Minister of Religion of the Republic of Indonesia Number 49 of 1963 dated February 25 1963, the Jakarta
            branch of IAIN became IAIN al Jamiah al Hukumiyyah Syarif Hidayatullah Jakarta.</p>
        <p>Inauguration of Prof. Drs. H.&nbsp;Sunardjo as Chancellor of IAIN Jakarta in 1963 also confirmed IAIN Jakarta
            as Faculty Coordinator in Greater Jakarta, West Java and Sumatra (During its development, these IAIN Jakarta
            branches then one by one became independent as IAIN and STAIN).</p>
        <p>In 1988, with the publication of Decree of the Minister of Religion of the Republic of Indonesia no.&nbsp;15
            of 1988, IAIN Syarif Hidayatullah Jakarta consists of the faculties: Tarbiyah, Adab, Ushuluddin, Sharia,
            Da'wah in Jakarta and the Faculty of Tarbiyah in Pontianak.</p>
        <p>In subsequent developments, based on Presidential Decree No. 11 of 1997 concerning Changes in the Status of
            Regional Faculties to State Islamic Religious Colleges (STAIN), the Pontianak Tarbiyah Faculty stood alone
            as STAIN Pontianak and IAIN Jakarta no longer had classes outside the Ciputat campus.</p>
        <p>During the leadership of Prof.&nbsp;Dr.&nbsp;Harun Nasution (1973-1984) IAIN Syarif Hidayatullah Jakarta was
            known as the "Renewer Campus", because he carried out many reforms in Islamic Thought with his rational
            thoughts, which even tended to be controversial (at that time it invited public reaction).&nbsp;Such as the
            inclusion of philosophy courses in the IAIN Jakarta curriculum and the sending of IAIN Syarif Hidayatullah
            Jakarta lecturers to the West.</p>
        <p>During this time, IAIN Jakarta also held the first Postgraduate Program (PPs) within IAIN throughout
            Indonesia.</p>
        <p>IAIN Syarif Hidayatullah Jakarta as one of the oldest IAINs in Indonesia, and located in the capital city of
            Jakarta, also occupies a unique and strategic position, not only as a "Window to Islam in Indonesia", but
            also a symbol for the progress of national development, especially in the field of religious development
            because The IAIN Syarif Hidayatullah Jakarta never stops developing to become a leading Islamic higher
            education institution.</p>
        <p>This development step began to be intensified during the leadership of Prof.</p>
        <p>In the 1998/1999 academic year.&nbsp;The Department of Psychology and Mathematics was opened at the Tarbiyah
            Faculty and the Department of Economics and Islamic Banking at the Sharia Faculty</p>
        <p>In the 2000/2001 academic year, the IAIN Conversion Study Program to UIN was opened, consisting of the
            Agribusiness Study Program (Agricultural Socioeconomics), Information Systems, Information Engineering,
            Management and Accounting.</p>
        <p>In the 2001/2002 academic year, the number of faculties increased with the opening of the Psychology Faculty
            (a metamorphosis of the Psychology department at the Tarbiyah Faculty) and the Dirasah Islamiyah Faculty
            (special classes using the Al Azhar system).&nbsp;The opening of these new study programs, especially the
            general sciences study program, is a significant step and is one of the efforts towards transforming IAIN
            Jakarta into a university.</p>
        <p>This effort received a recommendation in 2001 with the signing of a joint Decree between the Minister of
            National Education of the Republic of Indonesia Number 4/U/KB/2001 and the Minister of Religion of the
            Republic of Indonesia Number 500/2001 dated 21 November 2001 concerning the change from IAIN to UIN.</p>
        <p>In that same year 12 Social and Exact Study Programs (Information Engineering, Information Systems,
            Accounting, Management, Agribusiness (Agricultural Socioeconomics)) Psychology, English Language and
            Literature, Library Science, Mathematics, Chemistry, Physics and Biology received Operational
            Recommendations/Permits from Director General of Higher Education, Ministry of National Education of the
            Republic of Indonesia Number: 088796/MPN/2001 dated 22 November 2001.</p>
        <p>In the following year, the Draft Presidential Decree concerning Changes in the Form of IAIN to UIN Syarif
            Hidayatullah Jakarta received Recommendations and Consideration from the Minister for Administrative Reform
            of the Republic of Indonesia and the Director General of Budget, Ministry of Finance of the Republic of
            Indonesia Number 02/M-PAN/I/2002 dated January 9 2002 and Number S-490/MK -2/2002 dated February 14 2002,
            and this became the basis for changing IAIN Syarif Hidayatullah Jakarta to UIN Syarif Hidayatullah Jakarta.
        </p>
        <p><strong>May 20, 2002 |&nbsp;UIN Syarif Hidayatullah Jakarta</strong></p>
        <p>IAIN Syarif Hidayatullah Jakarta officially became UIN Syarif Hidayatullah Jakarta with the issuance of
            Presidential Decree No.&nbsp;031 dated 20 May 2002. This presidential decree became the basis for the formal
            legality of changing IAIN Syarif Hidayatullah Jakarta to become the State Islamic University of Syarif
            Hidayatullah Jakarta.</p>
        <p>Syarif Hidayatullah State Islamic University Jakarta at that time consisted of 9 faculties, namely: Faculty
            of Tarbiyah and Teacher Training, Faculty of Adab and Humanities, Faculty of Ushuludin and Philosophy,
            Faculty of Sharia and Law, Faculty of Da'wah and Communication, Faculty of Dirasat Islamiyah, Faculty of
            Psychology, Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences, Faculty of Science and Technology, with a total of 41
            departments/prodi with fields of study in general sciences and religious sciences.</p>
        <p>With this change, UIN Syarif Hidayatullah Jakarta is expected to encourage scientific integration in the
            fields of religion, humanity and Indonesianism with the aim of producing graduates who have integrative,
            adaptive, responsive and innovative insight into modern thinking and advances in science and technology in
            the era of globalization with a foundation of faith. , knowledge and charity which are the basis for the
            development of Islamic sciences, both Qur'anic sciences and Kauniyah sciences.</p>
        <p>This framework also underlies UIN Syarif Hidayatullah Jakarta in awarding undergraduate degrees in accordance
            with the Decree of the Chancellor of IAIN Syarif Hidayatullah Jakarta No.&nbsp;16 of 2002. In this decision
            it is stated that students who successfully complete their studies in the Bachelor's, Master's, and Doctoral
            Programs are entitled to receive a degree according to their study program.&nbsp;Thus, graduates of UIN
            Syarif Hidayatullah Jakarta are in the same position as graduates of other state universities in Indonesia.
        </p>
        <p>As a State Islamic University that is on par with other State Universities in Indonesia, starting from the
            2003/2004 academic year in accepting new students in addition to local admissions, UIN Syarif Hidayatullah
            was also included in the SPMB (New Student Admissions Selection) at a national standard.&nbsp;In this way,
            UIN Syarif Hidayatullah Jakarta has indirectly received national and international recognition.&nbsp;This
            recognition becomes the basic capital for building towards internationalization and globalization within the
            framework of a superior and competitive research university (Leading Towards Research University).</p>
        <p>Steps to integrate religious knowledge and general science also underlie the establishment of the Faculty of
            Medicine and Health Sciences (FKIK) at UIN Syarif Hidayatullah Jakarta in the 2004/2005 academic
            year.&nbsp;The establishment of FKIK was based on the Decree of the Minister of Religion SK No.MA/25/2004
            and the letter of the Director General of Higher Education (Dirjen Dikti) of the Department of National
            Education No.&nbsp;995/D/6/2004.</p>
        <p>Based on the above, in the 2004/2005 academic year, UIN Jakarta opened the Faculty of Medicine and Health
            Sciences with a Public Health Sciences Study Program based on the Director General of Higher Education's
            operational permit No.&nbsp;1338/D/P/2004 dated 12 April 2004 and the Pharmacy Study Program with
            operational permit No. 138/D2.2/2004 dated 6 August 2004 and Decree of the Director General of the
            Department of Religion No.&nbsp;DJ.11/274/2004 dated 8 August 2004.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the Medical Education study program and the Nursing Study Program were opened in the 2005/2006
            academic year based on the operational permit of the Directorate General of Higher Education no.
            1356/D/T/2005 dated 10 May 2005 and the Decree of the Director General of Bagais Number: May 17, 2005.</p>
        <p>The establishment of FKIK is in collaboration with FK UI as the Supervisory Faculty. Previously, UIN Syarif
            Hidayatullah Jakarta had collaborated to support the establishment of FKIK with various parties, including a
            number of hospitals in the Jakarta and Tangerang areas as practice places for students.</p>
        <p>UIN Syarif Hidayatullah Jakarta's commitment to becoming a Research University is to produce new discoveries
            in the field of science, both in religious sciences and general sciences, by placing research skills as the
            main qualification in every academic scientific performance.&nbsp;Because as a Research University, research
            ability is the main qualification in every appearance.</p>
        <p>Based on research, it is hoped that UIN Syarif Hidayatullah Jakarta can attract students, especially master
            and doctoral level students from various parts of the world, thereby creating academic, social, cultural
            exchange which in turn forms an intellectual community and learning society with research and analytical
            capabilities that can be applied. in various professional fields in a wider spectrum and UIN Syarif
            Hidayatullah Jakarta is ready to go international and become an International University.&nbsp;and become
            the Window of Academic Excellence of Islam in Indonesia (Window of Academic Excellence of Islam in
            Indonesia) as expected by figures fighting for Islamic education.</p>
        <p><strong>Become a Public Service Agency (BLU)</strong></p>
        <p>Since February 26 2008, the UIN Syarif Hidayatullah Jakarta Work Unit has been designated as a Public Service
            Agency (BLU) in the education category based on Minister of Finance Decree Number 42/KMK.05/2008.&nbsp;BLU
            is a government agency that was formed to provide services to the community in the form of providing goods
            and/or services that are sold without prioritizing making a profit.&nbsp;In carrying out its activities, BLU
            is based on the principles of efficiency and productivity.&nbsp;The group consists of health, education,
            fund management, area management, and other goods/services.</p>
        <p>What differentiates it from ordinary working units is the financial management pattern which provides
            flexibility in the form of freedom to implement sound business practices to improve services to the
            community.&nbsp;This aims to advance general welfare and make the nation's life more intelligent, as
            regulated in the Government Regulation regarding BLU financial management, as an exception to the provisions
            on state financial management in general.&nbsp;Since 2013, UIN Syarif Hidayatullah Jakarta has implemented
            remuneration for employees and lecturers.</p>
        <p><strong>The name is Syarif Hidayatullah</strong></p>
        <p>While several universities in Indonesia use the names of figures in the military field, IAIN prefers the
            names of figures in the religious field.&nbsp;The naming of IAIN Syarif Hidayatullah Jakarta (now UIN Syarif
            Hidayatullah Jakarta) is inseparable from the above.&nbsp;The name Syarif Hidayatullah was chosen because
            that name was the real name of one of the Walisongo, nine Islamic broadcasters on the island of Java, namely
            Sunan Gunung Jati who had a big role in the development of Islam in Sunda Kelapa (now Jakarta).</p>
        <p>Syarif Hidayatullah (Sunan Gunung Jati) was born in Arabia in 1448 AD and died in Cirebon in 1568 AD. He was
            the son of Nyai Rara Santang (daughter of King Siliwangi from Pajajaran) and Syarif Abdullah.&nbsp;The
            titles given to him were Muhammad Nuruddin, Sheikh Nurullah, Sayyid Kamil, Maulana Sheikh Makhdum
            Rahmatullah, and Makhdum Jati.&nbsp;After he died he was given the title "Sunan Gunung Jati".</p>
        <p>After reaching adulthood, Syarif Hidayatullah returned to Pajajaran and became the ruler of
            Cirebon.&nbsp;Since then he has played a role in broadcasting Islam in Java, especially the western
            part.&nbsp;Later he placed his son, Maulana Hasanuddin, as preacher and ruler in Banten.&nbsp;In 1527 AD,
            with the help of Fala-tehan (Fatahillah), he succeeded in controlling Sunda Kelapa after expelling
            Portuguese troops led by Francisco de Sa.</p>
        <p>Syarif Hidayatullah preached directly to community leaders and local nobles in a tactful manner.&nbsp;He
            began by providing knowledge of Islamic teachings or tazkirah about Islam and gentle warnings.&nbsp;He
            exchanged ideas from heart to heart with great tolerance.&nbsp;If this method does not work, then he resorts
            to arguing or mujjadi.&nbsp;This last method is applied especially to people who openly show disapproval of
            Islam.&nbsp;The da'wah method used by Syarif Hidayatullah has succeeded in attracting public sympathy.</p>
        <p>He also often helps poor and suffering people, both morally and materially.&nbsp;He communicated with the
            people's language, so that his teachings could be easily accepted.&nbsp;Syarif Hidayatullah did not sharply
            oppose the religion, beliefs and customs of the local population.&nbsp;Instead he shows the beauty and
            simplicity of Islam.&nbsp;What he does is show the superiority of Islam and equality between human beings.
        </p>
        <p>In order to foster the diversity of people from various ethnicities, he married the Regent of Banten's
            sister, daughter of Kaunganten (1475), Maulana Hasanuddin's mother;&nbsp;a Chinese princess, Ong Tien, in
            1481 (no children);&nbsp;Arab princess named Syarifah Bagdad, mother of Prince Jaya Kelana and Prince Brata
            Kelana;&nbsp;and Nyi Tepasari from Majapahit, mother of Queen Winahon and Prince Pasarean.</p>
        <p>Syarif Hidayatullah had a big role in establishing Islamic rule in Sunda Kelapa, which he later renamed
            Jayakarta and changed to Batavia by the Dutch.&nbsp;Therefore, it is hoped that the naming of Syarif
            Hidayatullah Jakarta can provide inspiration to the academic community in the development of Islam in
            Indonesia.</p>
