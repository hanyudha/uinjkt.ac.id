                quality of education offered.&nbsp;By focusing on achieving long-term goals, universities can improve
                their reputation and improve the quality of education and research.</li>
            <li>Adapting to Environmental Changes: Strategic plans help universities adapt to changes in the internal
                and external environment, such as changes in technology, labor market needs, or changing educational
                regulations.</li>
            <li>Attracting External Funds and Resources: A strong strategic plan can also assist universities in
                attracting external funds and resources, both from the public and private sectors, to support various
